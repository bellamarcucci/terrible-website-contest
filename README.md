# Customer Support Nightmare

Customer Support Nightmare is a deliberately bad user experience project created for the Terrible Website Contest.  
The goal of this project is to intentionally violate UX and UI best practices while still using valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website simulates an extremely frustrating customer support system with misleading buttons, intrusive popups, unreadable text, fake interactions and unnecessary obstacles.
